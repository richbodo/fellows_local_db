# User-Folder Durable Storage

A plan to move the durable home of the user's private relationships data out of browser-managed OPFS and into a user-chosen folder on their filesystem, following the VS Code for Web pattern: **browser as runtime, filesystem as durable home.**

## Context

Today, `relationships.db` lives in OPFS (Origin Private File System), owned by `vendor/sqlite-worker.js` per the local-first plan. OPFS is fast (sqlite-wasm gets `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`), private to the app's origin, and survives Clear App Cache. But it has three load-bearing user-experience problems:

1. **Invisible.** Users can't see, browse, back up, or move their `relationships.db` from outside the app. The "Where your data is stored" copy in `users_manual.md` essentially apologizes for this.
2. **Browser-coupled.** Clearing site data, switching browsers, switching devices, or having Android `Clear Storage` invoked on the browser all silently destroy data. The auto-backup ring is also in OPFS, so it dies with the same wipe.
3. **No external observability.** Backup is a manual download-then-store-the-file flow the user has to remember. Auto-backups don't escape OPFS.

VS Code for Web shows the inverse model: open a folder, work in the browser, every save is a real write to the user's filesystem. Files behave like files. Other apps can read them, sync services (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Syncthing) can replicate them, the user can `cp` them. The browser is just the runtime.

This plan brings that model to `relationships.db`.

## Goals

G1. **A real file at a real path.** After first-run setup, `relationships.db` exists at a user-chosen filesystem path. The user can browse to it in Finder / Explorer / `ls`. Auto-backups land in the same folder.
G2. **Durable across browser-data wipes.** Clearing site data, switching browsers (on the same machine), and switching browser profiles do not destroy the user's data — the folder survives.
G3. **Persistent permission across sessions.** A `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` saved in IndexedDB is re-acquired on every launch without re-prompting the user, when the underlying OS permission is still granted.
G4. **Honest "saved" semantics.** The UI displays "Saved to `<path>` at `<time>`" only after a successful write to the user's folder. Until then, status is explicit: "Pending save," "Browser-only (unsafe)," or "Folder inaccessible — re-select."
G5. **No silent data loss on permission lapse.** If the OS revokes folder access (user moved the folder, denied permission on session restart, etc.), the app continues to operate against the OPFS working copy, surfaces a prominent reconnect prompt, and refuses to declare anything "saved" until the folder is reachable again.
G6. **Graceful degradation on unsupported browsers.** On Safari, Firefox, and mobile (no `showDirectoryPicker`), the app continues to work in today's OPFS-only mode with an explicit "Browser-only (unsafe)" badge and a documented manual-backup workflow.
G7. **Migration without data loss.** Existing users with OPFS-only data are walked through folder setup on their first launch of the new version; their current OPFS contents are exported into the chosen folder before anything changes.

## Non-goals

- **`fellows.db` moves too.** Out of scope. `fellows.db` is a refreshable snapshot of a remote source — losing it means re-downloading, not losing user-created data. Stays in OPFS.
- **Multiple folders.** One folder per origin. Power users with multiple "directories of relationships" can wait until there's evidence demand exists.
- **Conflict resolution for folders synced across devices** (Dropbox, iCloud Drive, etc.). The folder is a single-writer durable store. Two browsers pointed at the same Dropbox-synced folder will produce dueling writes; we'll warn but not resolve.
- **Live folder watching.** `FileSystemObserver` is landing in Chrome but we don't depend on it. Pure write-out; no read-on-external-change.
- **Cross-device handle portability.** A directory handle is scoped to one browser on one machine. Moving to another machine requires re-picking a folder (typically a synced folder pointing at the same backing storage).
- **Folder-first as the only mode.** Even on Chromium, "Browser-only" remains a valid (unsafe-flagged) state for users who decline to pick a folder. We surface the warning; we don't force the choice.
- **Replacing OPFS as the working store.** sqlite-wasm performs best against OPFS-resident `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`s. The working DB stays in OPFS; the user's folder is the durable mirror. See § Architecture.

## Refreshable assets (images, fellows.db, etc.)

The plan above is about `relationships.db` — *user-authored* data we cannot regenerate from any other source. A separate class of assets is *refreshable*: bytes the server can hand back any time, that lose nothing if locally destroyed. Today that's `fellows.db` (regenerated from the Knack source on every build) and the ~250 profile images served from `/images/<slug>`.

The plan keeps `fellows.db` in OPFS by design — the per-build SHA in `/build-meta.json` already handles "is my local copy stale?" — but it does not yet address **images**. The gap matters: images are session-gated on prod, so a user who installs while their session is expired (or whose first boot lands in api+idb fallback for any other reason) gets *zero* profile photos and no mechanism to fill them in until they re-authenticate. We have a real user-report of this in the wild.

Three options, listed in increasing scope:

**Option A — Skip prewarm on unauthenticated boot + completeness counter.** The current image prewarm fires ~500 doomed requests every cold boot in api+idb fallback. Gate it on `authStatus.authenticated`. Add an About-page row: `Images: 230 / 251 cached — Sign in to fetch the rest` (linking to `/?gate=1`). Smallest possible fix; doesn't make images durable across browser-data wipes. Shippable independently of any folder work.

**Option B — Bundle images in the static bundle.** ~250 × ~30 KB ≈ 7-10 MB added to `deploy/dist/`. Images become as durable as `app.js` and signed by the same manifest. Trade-off: every directory-data update re-downloads all images even if only one changed. Could be mitigated by per-image hashes in `build-meta.json`, but that's its own work.

**Option C — Sync images into the user's folder once folder-mode is active (Phase 1+).** Folder-mode users get full durability — images survive Clear Site Data, browser switches, even hardware moves through a synced folder. OPFS-only users (mobile, Safari, Firefox) still need Option A as the floor since folder-mode never lands for them.

**Recommendation:** Option A now (it's a current production bug). Option C with Phase 2 (along with auto-sync). Option B held in reserve in case the bundle-weight conversation tips that way later.

Out of scope either way: a sync strategy for `fellows.db` itself. That's an existing concern handled by Check for updates → Update directory data and is unchanged by this plan.

## Browser compatibility matrix

| Browser / mode | `showDirectoryPicker` | Persistent handle re-grant | Behavior in this plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chrome / Edge / Brave (desktop, including PWA window)** | ✅ | ✅ via IndexedDB | Full feature. First-launch wizard. |
| **Arc** | ✅ (Chromium) | ✅ | Same as Chrome. |
| **Safari (desktop)** | ❌ (as of 2026 — `showOpenFilePicker` / `showSaveFilePicker` only; no directory) | n/a | Today's OPFS path, with persistent "Browser-only (unsafe)" badge + manual download/restore workflow. |
| **Firefox** | ❌ (no File System Access API) | n/a | Same as Safari. |
| **iOS Safari (incl. PWA)** | ❌ | n/a | Same as Safari desktop. |
| **Android Chrome (incl. PWA)** | ⚠️ Partial; directory picker exists but reliability and UX are mixed; OS app-data wipe via *Clear Storage* still beats the model. | ⚠️ Partial | **v1 treats mobile as unsupported.** Reuses the desktop-Safari fallback. Revisit when File System Access on Android matures. |

Bright line: **the user-folder feature is opt-in and additive.** Today's OPFS-only flow continues to work on every supported browser. We never block boot on the API being available.

### Why hybrid, not pure-folder

- sqlite-wasm's fast VFS (`OpfsSAHPoolVfs`) needs `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`. Sync access handles are **OPFS-only.** Files in user-picked folders only expose async `FileSystemFileHandle` / `FileSystemWritableFileStream`.
- A pure-folder model would either need a custom async-only VFS (every read/write becomes a Promise — measurable hit even for small DBs; complex code) or have sqlite-wasm work entirely in-memory and rewrite the whole file on every commit (correctness risk on crash; thrashes the OS file cache).
- Hybrid keeps today's working-store performance unchanged. The only new code path is "after a committed mutation, copy the .db bytes out to the user's folder." That's cheap (the DB is tens of KB), debounceable, and idempotent.

### Sync-out cadence

- **Trigger:** every committed write RPC the worker handles for `relationships.db` enqueues a sync.
- **Debounce:** 500 ms after the last commit, or 5 s max wait, whichever fires first. Tunable.
- **Atomicity:** write to `relationships.db.tmp`, then `move` to `relationships.db`. The user never sees a half-written file. The renaming pattern matches what `Atomics`-flavored save flows use elsewhere.
- **Failure:** logged + surfaced as "Sync failed at `<time>`: `<reason>` — Retry?" in the status badge. **The committed change in OPFS is not rolled back** — the working DB and the durable mirror diverge until the next successful sync. This is the only state where they ever diverge, and it's visible.

### Auto-backup ring

- Existing auto-backup logic moves to the user's folder. Filenames continue to follow the `relationships.db.bak.<ISO timestamp>` pattern.
- Rotation continues server-side-equivalent — keep the newest N (currently 3) backups; on each new backup, prune older ones in the folder.
- If the user inspects the folder, the rotation is visible: `relationships.db`, `relationships.db.bak.2026-05-14T10-32Z`, etc.

### Boot sequence

1. Worker spawns.
2. Worker opens OPFS pool, attaches `fellows.db` RO (unchanged from today).
3. Worker reads the saved folder handle from IndexedDB.
4. **If handle missing** → "Browser-only (unsafe)" state. OPFS working DB is the source of truth. Bootstrap schema if absent. Continue.
5. **If handle present** → call `queryPermission({mode: 'readwrite'})`:
   - `'granted'` → read `relationships.db` from the folder, copy into OPFS, attach. **"Saved" state.**
   - `'prompt'` → don't auto-prompt. Continue against OPFS working DB but surface a "Reconnect data folder" CTA in the status badge that, on click, calls `requestPermission`.
   - `'denied'` → same as `'prompt'` plus an explicit "Permission was denied; you'll need to pick the folder again."
6. **If handle present but folder empty / file missing** → "Folder selected but empty: was your data moved?" with options to "Restore from this folder's backups" / "Restore from the auto-backups inside OPFS" / "Choose a different folder" / "Start fresh in this folder."

A new mutation always lands in OPFS first, then syncs out. So a stale-permission session is still safe: the data is preserved in OPFS even if the folder write keeps failing.

## UI / UX

### Status surfaces: durability vs completeness

The status badge below tracks **where your data is saved** — Browser-only / Pending / Saved / Folder inaccessible. That is "data durability."

A separate concern, surfaced elsewhere, is **install completeness** — has the app downloaded every refreshable asset it depends on, so subsequent server-less use is fully functional? On a normal authenticated install, prewarm fills the image cache and the answer is yes. On an install whose first boot landed in api+idb fallback (expired session, anti-enum 403, etc.), the answer is no — *and the durability badge has no way to express that.* The user's data is durable; the install itself is partial.

Don't conflate the two in the same badge. Surface completeness on the About page (where the user already goes to ask "is everything okay with this install?") as a separate row, with a link to sign-in when items are missing. The signal evolves as Phase 1 / 2 land — once images sync into the user's folder, the same "X of N images present" check applies, just against a different storage substrate.

### Status badge (the load-bearing UI element)

Lives in Settings → top of the *Your saved data* section, and also as a small pill in the app's persistent header (mobile redesign mockup-compatible).

| State | Badge text | Color | Affordances |
|---|---|---|---|
| Saved | `Saved to /Users/rich/Documents/Fellows • 2 min ago` | green | "Show in Finder", "Change folder…" |
| Pending save | `Saving to folder…` | neutral | (none — transient, ~500ms) |
| Browser-only (no folder ever chosen) | `Browser-only — your data is not yet saved to disk` | yellow / warning | **"Choose a data folder…"** CTA |
| Folder selected but inaccessible | `Folder set but unreachable — reconnect to keep saving` | yellow / warning | **"Reconnect folder…"** CTA |
| Sync failed (last attempt errored) | `Last save failed (<reason>) • Retry` | yellow / warning | **"Retry now"** + "Change folder…" |
| Unsupported browser | `Browser-only — this browser doesn't support saving to a folder` | yellow / warning | Link to docs explaining the manual backup flow |

Critical rule: **"Saved" is shown only after a write to the user's folder has been acknowledged by the OS.** OPFS writes alone are never "Saved" — they're "Pending" or "Browser-only," depending on whether a folder has ever been chosen.

### First-launch wizard (Phase 3)

When an existing user (OPFS data exists, no folder handle set) opens the new version:

1. Banner above the directory: *"Your data is currently only in this browser. Choose a folder to save it to disk."* Dismissible (continues "Browser-only"), one click to engage.
2. On click, native folder picker. User picks (or creates) a folder.
3. App writes the current OPFS contents (relationships.db + the existing auto-backup ring) to the folder atomically.
4. Status flips to "Saved to `<path>`."
5. Subsequent launches from this browser auto-reconnect via the saved handle.

### Settings page additions

In the existing *Your saved data* section, above the existing download / restore buttons:

- **Data folder:** `<path>` or `Not set` — with **Choose folder…** / **Change folder…** / **Disconnect folder** buttons.
- **Last saved:** `<ISO time>` or `Never`.
- **Open folder:** invokes whatever the platform's "show in file manager" call is (limited support; degrade gracefully).

The existing "Download my user data" stays — it's still useful for grabbing a snapshot to email someone, restore on another machine, etc. The new "Saved to folder" state doesn't replace it.

## Permission model & handle persistence

### Storing the handle

`FileSystemDirectoryHandle` is structured-clonable, so it can be put directly into IndexedDB. We store it in a new IDB database `fellows-fs-handles`, key `relationships-folder`. Single entry; no need to manage multiple.

This survives Clear App Cache (per the existing behavior; IDB is not site-data in the OPFS-strict sense — but **it IS cleared by "Clear site data" / full reset**). Worth being precise in docs.

### Permission lifecycle

On each session start, we call `queryPermission({mode: 'readwrite'})`. The three return values map to:

- `'granted'` — proceed silently. No user-visible prompt.
- `'prompt'` — the OS needs user gesture to re-grant. **We do not auto-`requestPermission` on boot** (no user gesture available, would fail or pop a confusing dialog mid-load). Instead surface a "Reconnect data folder" button; clicking it is the gesture.
- `'denied'` — same UX path. We say "Folder was selected previously but permission has been denied — reconnect to continue."

If the user explicitly clicks "Disconnect folder," we delete the IDB entry and revert to "Browser-only (unsafe)."

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Worker-direct export / import (pre-cursor, shippable now)

**Independent of all the user-folder work below.** Decouples the page-side `dataProvider` from the worker's relationship-DB byte operations, which Phase 2's auto-sync needs anyway and which fixes a current production bug for free.

The page-level `dataProvider` today exposes `exportRelationshipsBytes` / `importRelationshipsBytes` only when its `kind === 'worker'`. When the page falls back to `api+idb` (most commonly because the session-gated `/fellows.db` fetch returned 401/403 during boot), the warm worker is still alive with `relationships.db` open, but the Settings backup and restore controls can't reach it — so users on an expired session can't back up their data before reinstalling or switching browsers.

Phase 2's debounced sync ("worker enqueues a sync after every committed mutation") is written from the worker's perspective and similarly cannot depend on the active page-level provider. The plumbing is the same: a worker-direct path to the bytes, addressable regardless of which provider the page picked at boot. Landing it here shortens Phase 2.

- New page-side helpers that reach `warmWorker.rpc` directly:
  - `warmWorkerExportRelationshipsBytes()`
  - `warmWorkerImportRelationshipsBytes(bytes)`
  - `warmWorkerListRelationshipsBackups()` (for the auto-backup list in Settings)
- Settings page wires the download / restore buttons through the warm-worker helpers when `dataProvider.kind !== 'worker'` AND `isWorkerOpfsCapableButInactive()` (the helper added in the never-SaaS copy cleanup, PR #173).
- When the warm worker is genuinely absent (no OPFS, no worker init), keep today's "this feature isn't available" panel — that's the honest case.
- E2E: extend `tests/e2e/test_never_saas_copy.py` (or sibling) to seed the api+idb-fallback scenario, click Download, assert a real `relationships.db` blob comes back; click Restore on a known-good blob, assert the worker accepted it.

Out of scope for P0: anything about user-picked folders, the status badge state machine, IDB handle persistence, the migration wizard. Those all stay below.

### Phase 0b — Worker-direct groups RPCs (small follow-on)

Same shape as Phase 0, extended to the five groups RPCs (`listGroups`, `getGroup`, `createGroup`, `updateGroup`, `deleteGroup`) so the entire `relationships.db` read/write surface — settings, backups, AND groups — stays reachable when the page falls back to api+idb. Without this, a user with an expired session could back up their data (P0) but couldn't browse the groups they were trying to back up.

- Prereq: hoist `attachMemberNamesFromCache` and `withResolvedMembers` out of `createWorkerDataProvider`'s scope to module scope. Both read only the module-level `fellowsBySlug` cache; the hoist is mechanical.
- Extend `viaWarmWorker` (added in P0) to accept an optional post-process function so `getGroup` / `createGroup` / `updateGroup` can chain `withResolvedMembers`.
- Five new methods on `createApiPlusIdbDataProvider`, same dispatcher pattern as P0.

Out of scope for P0b: version-skew gating on mutating group ops in the api+idb path. The worker provider gates create/update/delete with `refuseIfVersionSkew`; the api+idb fallback doesn't, on the rationale that the fallback path is already exceptional and worker-vs-page version skew is a separate SW-upgrade-race concern surfaced by the existing reload banner. Worth revisiting if real-user telemetry shows skew-related failures.

### Phase 1 — Folder picker + status UI + manual save/restore

**Shippable on its own.** No automatic sync; the user explicitly hits "Save to folder" or "Refresh from folder" buttons in Settings. Validates the API surface, the handle-storage model, and the status UI before adding cadence logic.

- New `vendor/sqlite-worker.js` RPCs: `getFolderHandle()`, `setFolderHandle(handle)`, `writeRelationshipsToFolder()`, `readRelationshipsFromFolder()`, `checkFolderPermission()`.
- Settings page UI for choose / change / disconnect folder.
- Status badge with the six states from § UI / UX (only the manual subset is wired — Saved / Pending / Browser-only / Folder inaccessible).
- Unit test for the IndexedDB handle persistence.
- E2E test (Chromium-only) using Playwright's `BrowserContext.grantPermissions(['fileSystem'])` and the underlying CDP to seed a directory handle.

Out of scope for P1: auto-sync, migration wizard, fellow.db.

### Phase 2 — Automatic debounced sync

- Worker enqueues a sync after every committed mutation to `relationships.db`.
- Debounce: 500 ms quiet period, 5 s max wait.
- Atomic write via `.tmp` + rename.
- Sync-failed state surfaces in status badge with "Retry now."
- Auto-backup rotation moves to the user's folder (Phase 1 leaves auto-backups in OPFS).

### Phase 3 — First-launch migration wizard

- Banner for OPFS-only users on first launch after P3 ships.
- One-click "Choose folder & save now" flow.
- Bulk export of current OPFS contents into the chosen folder (relationships.db + auto-backup ring).

### Phase 4 — Polish & accessibility (post-MVP)

- "Show in Finder" via `showDirectoryPicker` round-trip when supported.
- "Open data folder" deep link if any platform exposes it without re-picking.
- Diagnostic panel additions (folder path, last sync time, sync-failure count, current permission state).
- Maybe-eventual: `FileSystemObserver` watch on the folder so external edits surface as conflicts.

## Plan-polish items (not blocking, worth resolving before code lands)

Two gaps surfaced during a plan review. Neither blocks ship; both are worth a sentence each in the relevant phase before that phase starts.

**G1 — Post-commit hook on relationships.db RPCs (Phase 2 dependency).** Phase 2's spec says "Worker enqueues a sync after every committed mutation to `relationships.db`." The worker's current RPC shape doesn't have a notion of "this RPC just committed a mutation" — most handlers read and write synchronously inside one function with no after-hook. P2 needs a small "post-commit" concept: each RPC that mutates `relationships.db` (createGroup, updateGroup, deleteGroup, setSetting, importRelationshipsBytes, …) flags the worker to schedule a debounced sync after the response is sent. Cleanest implementation is probably a small `markRelationshipsDirty()` helper called at the end of each mutating RPC, with the debounce timer living at module scope. Worth wiring in P2 the day P2 code starts.

**G2 — `fellows.db.meta.json` sidecar location and migration.** Today the SHA-keyed sidecar that drives the About → Check for updates flow lives in OPFS at `fellows.db.meta.json` (sibling of the SAH pool). The plan moves `relationships.db` to the user's folder but is silent on the sidecar. Decision needed: stays in OPFS (sidecar tracks the OPFS-resident `fellows.db`, which never moves under this plan), or moves to the folder alongside `relationships.db` (so a user copying their folder to a new machine sees the same update-state). Reco: **stays in OPFS** — it tracks `fellows.db` freshness on this device, which is per-device by definition. A new device starts with an empty sidecar and re-fetches naturally. Worth one sentence in § Architecture once decided, and a note in the migration wizard (Phase 3) confirming the wizard does NOT copy the sidecar.

## Open questions for @richbodo

Each one needs your call before phase 1 code lands.

**Q1: Folder layout — single file or directory?**

Option A: drop `relationships.db` straight into the folder the user picks (alongside whatever's already there). Pros: matches "it's just a file" intuition. Cons: auto-backups (`relationships.db.bak.*`) and any future metadata clutter the user's folder.

Option B: require an empty folder, treat the folder as ours, manage all contents (`relationships.db`, backups, maybe a `.fellows-manifest.json`). Pros: clean ownership boundary. Cons: more friction on first setup; pickier about pre-existing folders.

Option C: drop a subfolder. User picks a parent folder; we make `EHF Fellows Data/` inside it and own that. Compromise; mirrors how VS Code creates `.vscode/`.

**Recommendation:** C — clearest user mental model, no destructive collisions, naming visible in Finder.

**Q2: What happens when the picked folder already contains a `relationships.db`?**

Scenarios: user re-installs and points at their old folder (✓ we want to load that), user picks a colleague's folder by accident (✗ we should not silently merge), user picks the SAME folder another browser is also using (✗ split-brain).

**Recommendation:** if the chosen folder contains `relationships.db`, show a confirm dialog: *"This folder already has fellows data — `<groups summary>`. Use it?* / Keep my browser's data and back this folder's data up first / Cancel". Don't silently merge.

**Q3: Mobile in the matrix — pretend unsupported, or partial Android support?**

Android Chrome 121+ does support `showDirectoryPicker`, but with worse permission persistence and *Clear Storage* still nuking handles. v1 plan calls it unsupported; the alternative is "partial — works but bigger 'unsafe in Android Settings' warnings."

**Recommendation:** v1 unsupported. Treat mobile as today's OPFS-only flow. Revisit when Android File System Access feels solid.

**Q4: Diagnostic surface — how much state to expose?**

The full permission lifecycle (handle present, last permission query result, last sync attempt + outcome, current path) is useful for support cases. Could land in the existing `?diag` panel.

**Recommendation:** yes, add a "Data folder" subsection to the `?diag` panel. Low cost; high payoff when someone files a "I lost my data" issue.

**Q5: Naming.**

Settings UI calls it: data folder? backup folder? sync folder? save folder? Worth picking one and using it everywhere.

**Recommendation:** "**Data folder**" — implies durability and ownership; doesn't mislead users into thinking it's a backup of something else.

## Testing approach

- **Unit:** IndexedDB handle round-trip; sync-out write logic against a stubbed `FileSystemDirectoryHandle`.
- **Playwright E2E (Chromium):** seed a folder handle via CDP, exercise full save / load / disconnect / reconnect flows. Verify status-badge state machine.
- **Manual smoke:**
  - Chrome desktop PWA: full happy path.
  - Chrome desktop PWA + revoke permission via Site Settings → permission-prompt path.
  - Chrome desktop PWA + user-moves-folder-out-from-under-us → "folder inaccessible" state.
  - Safari desktop: confirms unsupported-browser badge appears without spamming errors.
  - Firefox: same.
  - iOS Safari PWA: same.

### Mobile verification

The plan calls mobile "unsupported in v1" for folder-mode itself — neither iOS nor Android Chrome will see the folder picker until / unless we revisit. But **the OPFS-only fallback path IS the mobile experience** and that path absolutely needs verification: the image-prewarm-on-fallback bug bit a real mobile user before we noticed it, and "we tested on desktop Chrome" did not catch it. We're shipping a PWA primarily consumed on phones; not having a mobile test loop is the gap that lets bugs like that ship to the user before we notice.

Options for adding a mobile test loop, listed in increasing fidelity / cost:

- **Playwright mobile emulation** (we use it today in `tests/e2e/mobile/`). UA + viewport spoofing. Catches CSS / layout regressions; does *not* replicate WebKit-on-iOS (Playwright Chromium is still Chromium under the hood) or Android Chrome's storage-eviction behavior. Better than nothing; insufficient on its own.
- **BrowserStack / Sauce Labs / similar.** Real iOS Safari and Android Chrome, scriptable from CI. Costs money; replicates engine + storage quirks. Worth it for security and privacy-sensitive features once we have the appetite.
- **Manual ship checklist on a personal phone.** Per-deploy smoke (≈ a quarter-hour). Catches the worst bugs; can't be automated. Belongs in `docs/users_manual.md` or a sibling so any maintainer can run it.

**Recommendation for #165:** before Phase 1 ships, formalize the manual mobile checklist as the floor; revisit cloud-device testing in Phase 4 alongside other polish. Even on desktop-only features, run the manual mobile pass once to confirm the OPFS-only fallback didn't degrade.

This is also a good time to remember the AC-12 commitment in `docs/Architecture.md` (capability detection inside the worker): mobile is where AC-12 gets stressed the most, since iOS WebKit constraints differ from desktop Safari's in ways that don't always surface in Playwright.

## Risks

- **OPFS and folder drift permanently if sync keeps failing.** Mitigation: status badge surfaces the divergence loudly; auto-retry on next mutation; "Save now" button always available.
- **User picks a folder inside a synced location (Dropbox/iCloud) and runs the app in two browsers.** Mitigation: Q2's "already has data here?" dialog catches the first case; multi-writer is documented as unsupported in `users_manual.md`.
- **`Clear site data` still wipes the IDB-stored handle**, forcing re-pick. Mitigation: the FOLDER survives, so the user just re-picks and the data is unchanged. Document this in `users_manual.md` as the recovery path.
- **Browser auto-revokes file system permissions on idle eviction.** Chrome does this for tabs that have been backgrounded for a long time. Mitigation: the `'prompt'` state and reconnect CTA already cover this. Tested.
